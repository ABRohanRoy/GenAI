Staying fit requires a blend of gym-based routines, calisthenics, and athletic discipline. Calisthenics focuses on bodyweight exercises like push-ups and pull-ups, ideal for building functional strength. Gym workouts often involve machines and weights targeting different muscle groups. Athletic training, common among sports professionals, emphasizes agility, endurance, and coordination. Whether you're training for fitness or performance, consistency is key.
